** DO NOT COMMIT THIS INTO REPO **

To commit some changes and update versioning on Bower and npm,

1) Commit your changes
2) Manually update version number in bower.json and package.json
3) Create dist files by running "grunt dist"
4) Add an entry in CHANGELOG.md
4) Create release commit with changes of 2, 3 and 4
4) Tag the release with version (git tag vx.y.z) (Yes, "v" must be part of the tag)
5) Push the commit and tags (git push github master && git push --tags)
6) Notify npm (npm publish)
